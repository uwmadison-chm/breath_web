# Web-based breath counting tool

A django + Flash app to help track breath counting

## Overview

This is a very old (2011-vintage) Django-based web app to track breath counting performance. It has a plain HTML interface, as well as a Flash-based interface that communicates with the server.

This documentation is extremely incomplete; I'm writing it in 2019 and haven't worked on the code in about eight years.

## Installation

This is a pretty straightforward, albeit old, Django app. You may need to either install a version of Django that was modern circa 2011, or update the app to run in a modern version.

## Running the app

Change experiment settings and add subjects in the Django admin interface.

## Contributing

This app is completely unmaintained, and provided for historical and open science purposes. There are no current plans to maintain it again. To make changes, please fork this repository and edit in your fork.

## Credits

This app was developed at the Waisman Center for Brain Imaging, for a study run by [Daniel Levinson](mailto:danlevinson@gmail.com). Web code was written by [Nate Vack](mailto:njvack@wisc.edu) and Flash code was written by [David Gagnon](mailto:djgagnon@wisc.edu).
