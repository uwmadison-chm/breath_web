# Web-based breath counting tool

A django + Flash app to help track breath counting

## Overview

This is a very old (2011-vintage) Django-based web app to track breath counting performance. It has a plain HTML interface, as well as a Flash-based interface that communicates with the server.

This documentation is extremely incomplete; I'm writing it in 2019 and haven't worked on the code in about eight years.

## Installation

This is a pretty straightforward, albeit old, Django app. You may need to either install a version of Django that was modern circa 2011, or update the app to run in a modern version.

## Running experiments

To set up an experiment, go to the admin interface and create an Experiment. The following settings will be of interest:

* **URL slug**: The base path for your experiment â€” after creating your experiment, participants will go to `https://<your_domain>/<app_path>/<experiment_url_slug>`.
* **Run length**: How long (in seconds) you want to collect data
* **Survey url**: After data collection ends, the URL for a followup survey (in Qualtrics or REDCap or whatever)
* **Chime on error**: If you want a little ding to play for a miscount
* **Run instructions**: Custom instructions to show to the participant
* **Guide sound file**: An optional MP3 to play during data collection
* **Breath time key**: For most breaths, press this key. I'm not sure how to specify arrow keys here, but we've done that before I think.
* **End cycle key**: The key to press at the end of a count cycle
* **Cycle length**: How long the breath cycle should be
* **Practice cycles**: How much practice they'll do. There's a guided and unguided practice.
* **Use swf url**: An optional URL for a flash file to show during data collection. If this is blank, participants will see a neutral screen during data collection.
